This is a self aware Anti-Cheat I made in C++, not a game. The game probably occupies %5-%10 of the actual source code, so expect it to be thorough.

1. You must run the Anti-Cheat Installer application first or the BypassMe will refuse to let you play.
2. If you get banned (You will know what I am talking about) there are ways to unban yourself, or you can contact me @HotPocket#5463 on discord.
the DEPENDENCIES file is seperate from the solution and is meant to be added into the include directories in project settings.
